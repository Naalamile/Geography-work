                The archaeological site at Daboya, located on the west bank of the White Volta River in northern Ghana, 
                offers valuable insights into the origins and growth of the Gonja state, a prominent 16th-century polity. In 1989,
                 archaeologists Peter Shinnie and Francois Kense conducted extensive excavations across four seasons (1978, 1979, 1982, and 1983)
                  to uncover the settlement's early history and cultural significance. Covering approximately 0.75 square kilometers, the Daboya site 
                  features a wealth of cultural materials, unique pottery traditions, and other artifacts,
                 reflecting a rich occupational history spanning around 4000 years, making it one of West Africa's oldest inhabited areas.
            </p>
            <p class=" text-justify">
                The artifact collection for Daboya includes over 330,000 potsherds,
                 which were categorized into seven distinct pottery traditions, representing 
                 different time periods and cultural influences. These traditions highlight the
                  evolution of ceramic techniques and decorative styles, ranging from the early 
                  Kintampo complex (2000-1000 BC) to the Silima and Yagha traditions linked to the 13th-19th centuries.
                   The pottery styles, along with other artifacts like smoking pipes, terracotta figurines, stone tools, and metal objects,
                 suggest that Daboya was a dynamic cultural hub, potentially influenced by both local and broader West African interactions.

            <p class="mt-4 text-justify">
                The Daboya site has four occupational phases:
                Phase A represents the Kintampo occupation during the second millennium B.C., indicated by radiocarbon dates.
                Phase B marks the Early Iron Age, featuring two pottery traditions and spanning approximately 1000 years from the first millennium B.C. to the first millennium A.D.
                Phase C, dated to 1180 ± 165 B.P. (605–935 AD.), shows a variety of ceramics possibly produced by different ethnic groups engaged in trade or exchange.
                Phase D, associated with Silima pottery, dates post-12th century A.D. and reflects a broad distribution in northwestern Ghana, hinting at specialized production centers like New Buipe.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4 text-justify">
                Artifacts such as terracotta figurines and smoking pipes reveal aspects of the social life of 
                Daboya's past inhabitants. The figurines, which may have held spiritual significance, and the 
                smoking pipes, likely introduced as a result of European contact, add depth to the understanding 
                of Daboya’s cultural practices. Through its archaeological record, Daboya serves as a vital link to West Africa's historical trajectory,
                 highlighting its significance as a longstanding settlement shaped by multiple cultural and trade influences.
